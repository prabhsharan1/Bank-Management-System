* Banks are incorporated into our daily life activities like paying salaries, withdrawals, and savings.

Various types of bank accounts exist to attend to the different needs of the consumers. The following are the different types of banking accounts and the purpose they serve.

* **Savings accounts:** This account type is used to set aside finances for future use. Most of the saving accounts pay interest on the deposits over time and have no debit or credit cards. Savings accounts are opened as a better place to keep the money for use at a later date, separate one's savings from everyday spending cash, and provide safety of finances.

* **Checking accounts:** These are accounts that are used for everyday spending. These accounts are often linked to debit cards which can be used for purchases or ATM withdrawals. Checking accounts are purposely to hold money in a secure place for a limited duration of time and convenient payment of bills.
